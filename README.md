Magical 8bit Plug 2 is a software-synthesizer developed by Yokemura YMCK which generates primitive electronic sounds like the old 8bit game consoles. It can be used as a plug-in for the host applications that support Audio Units or VST.

Magical 8bit Plug 2 can produce the 8bit-specific sounds, namely pseudo triangle and low resolution noise, that are hard to reproduce with ordinary synthesizers. It also implements precise controls for 8bit-style expressions like pseudo polyphony and duty envelope.


Features:
-	Basic 8bit-style waveforms
-	As the new waveforms, 1-bit noise is introduced, which can emulate the sound of original 8bit console more accurately
-	Envelope forming with so-called ADSR
-	Pitch bend capability with depth control
-	Auto Bending which is suitable for making sound effects and drum sound
-	Vibrato to enrich your musical expression
-	Custom envelopes, which gives you more precise control over volume, pitch, resolution and pulse duty values
-	Portamento for smooth transition between the notes
